    <h1> CR-Fix 1.2.1 - Final Update</h1>
    This is the last release of CR-Fix.
    Crunchyroll created a new frontend and moved it out of beta
    as of 2022-10-19. The plugin isn't compatibel with the new frontend
    and I don't intended to rewrite everything.
    Once the old design is fully gone with the planned shutdown of some
    features in November 2022 there's probably no reason to keep the extension
    installed.<br />
    The good news is some of the fixes this extension still offered in 1.2
    are no longer necessary by now. (Unfortunately, some new bugs popped up.
    E.g. even before the new design -  wrt subtitle scaling making them blurred
    on most HiDPI displays, but fixing them from an extension would be too much
    effort. A simple workaround is to zoom-out of the page to increase the sub
    resolution. This effect persists on fullscreening the player.)
    <h2>Improvements:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Fix Update notification showing up on every browser update
         instead of only updates of the extension itself.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h1> CR-Fix 1.2 - Update</h1>
    <h2> New Feaures: </h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Customisable navbar</dt>
      <dd>
        Re-Add the 'Forum' tab to the navbar and/or remove tabs you don't need!
      </dd>

      <dt>Startpage: Top Simulcast</dt>
      <dd>
        Move the simulcast section on the startpage to the top, directly below the news carousel.
        (Moves it above the news section) <br />
        Allows you to quickly get an overview of the current releases.
      </dd>

      <dt>Experimental: Custom SegmentId-Event</dt>
      <dd>
        Useful in some cases where the original event does not get triggered properly.
        (Prevents the player from showing up) <br />
        If you don't have problems with the player showing up, than you don't need this.
      </dd>
    </ul>

        Go to settings and give it a try!
    </a>
    </p>


    <h2> Other Improvements: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved sidebar positioning for preview episodes and when logged in.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug which reversed logging priority</li>
      <li>Minor clarifications on setting page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Disabled Features: </h2>
    <div style="font-size: 90%">
    <p>
    Unfortunately I had to disable the quality and language selection as an update of the
    Crunchyroll player broke them and they became unusable.
    I couldn't find a reasonable way to restore the functionality.
    If you feel like you can do better or just want to know a bit more about the restrictions, check
    <a href="https://github.com/TheOneric/CR-Fixes/issues/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
        here
    </a>
    for more details.
    </p><p>
    Another setting that had to go is the experimental "Request DRM-free streams".
    Crunchyroll does no longer acknowledge this cookie, <strong>but</strong>
    it now falls back to a sane DRM-free HLS stream by default, when WIdevine is not
    supported on the target device. So there's no need for this setting anymore anyway.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temporarily(?) disabled quality and language selection</li>
      <li>Removed "Ex: Request DRM-free streams" setting</li>
    </ul>
