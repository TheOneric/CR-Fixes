    <h1> CR-Fix 1.2 - Update</h1>
    <h2> New Feaures: </h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Customisable navbar</dt>
      <dd>
        Re-Add the 'Forum' tab to the navbar and/or remove tabs you don't need!
      </dd>

      <dt>Startpage: Top Simulcast</dt>
      <dd>
        Move the simulcast section on the startpage to the top, directly below the news carousel.
        (Moves it above the news section) <br />
        Allows you to quickly get an overview of the current releases.
      </dd>

      <dt>Experimental: Custom SegmentId-Event</dt>
      <dd>
        Useful in some cases where the original event does not get triggered properly.
        (Prevents the player from showing up) <br />
        If you don't have problems with the player showing up, than you don't need this.
      </dd>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;">
    <a href="settings_full.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
        Go to settings and give it a try!
    </a>
    </p>


    <h2> Other Improvements: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved sidebar positioning for preview episodes and when logged in.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug which reversed logging priority</li>
      <li>Minor clarifications on setting page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Disabled Features: </h2>
    <div style="font-size: 90%">
    <p>
    Unfortunately I had to disable the quality and language selection as an update of the
    Crunchyroll player broke them and they became unusable.
    I couldn't find a reasonable way to restore the functionality.
    If you feel like you can do better or just want to know a bit more about the restrictions, check
    <a href="https://github.com/TheOneric/CR-Fixes/issues/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
        here
    </a>
    for more details.
    </p><p>
    Another setting that had to go is the experimental "Request DRM-free streams".
    Crunchyroll does no longer acknowledge this cookie, <strong>but</strong>
    it now falls back to a sane DRM-free HLS stream by default, when WIdevine is not
    supported on the target device. So there's no need for this setting anymore anyway.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temporarily(?) disabled quality and language selection</li>
      <li>Removed "Ex: Request DRM-free streams" setting</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
