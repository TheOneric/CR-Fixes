PRIO HIGH:
- Generate viloz script dynamically to resolve future conflicts when integrating foreign (L)GPL code (viloz_player.js does not fall under GPL as it is copied from crunchyroll.com)
 However this does create a possible security risk, if the fetch of original script were to be manipulated, but then again: If an attakcer can manipulate this request, he could also manipulate the regular request happening without this plugin. But I need to think this through â€¦
- Add simple darktheme (with orange highlights if possible)

PRIO MEDIUM:
- Add hierachic subtitle selection (.subtitlesMenuItemSelector)
   Useful resource:  https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/374477-crunchyroll-video-utilities/code
- Add option for default video quality
   Useful resource (lgpl3): https://github.com/tholinka/Dark-Crunchyroll-Plugin/commit/d1bec3c7cf314e4d22b416ccd0d4e6eabd5660b1


PRIO LOW:
- Fix Bug where Text/Number input in settings page is at start always disabled (easy workaround: toggle corresponding slider 2 times)
