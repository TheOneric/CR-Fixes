PRIO HIGH:
- Fix bug, that player controls are not fully accesible when player is enlarged


PRIO MEDIUM:


- Make sure darktheme css takes precedence (is last css in header, to get rid of blue links)

- DT improvements:
	Add 
	.message-container a {
		color: #cc720c;
	}
	rule
	
	Make sure own
	.new-template-body .text-link
	rule takes precedence


PRIO LOW:
- Fix Bug where Text/Number input in settings page is at start always disabled (easy workaround: toggle corresponding slider 2 times)
- Update div#container.cf colour when darkmode is toggled via popup
