PRIO HIGH:
- Find and eliminate bug where sub and quality injection sometimes fails even in the active tab
  ( possibly permission request is rejected because not directly in event handler ? )

PRIO MEDIUM:


PRIO LOW:
- Move div#container.cf colour to darkmode stylesheet, only add seperate style tag when no theme is used
- Add OPTIONAL (Advanced setting) mode for injection where 'tabs' permission is requested so that injection also works in not-active tabs
