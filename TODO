PRIO HIGH:
- Make sure all settings are assigned a value on startup
 (Move var _Def_seeting to object DEFSET and iterate through components)


PRIO MEDIUM:
- Move all (debug,error,normal)logs into lib_util, prefix them with [CRF] 
  and Make debug messsages toggable in experimental settings
- Rename experimental settings to something more fitting



PRIO LOW:
- Fix Bug where Text/Number input in settings page is at start always disabled (easy workaround: toggle corresponding slider 2 times)
- Move div#container.cf colour to darkmode stylesheet, only add seperate style tag when no theme is used
